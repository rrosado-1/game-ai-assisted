Just a repo to brainstorm some ideas of how to integrate AI into videogames in more creative and meaningful ways.


## The Vision
### Scenario 1: Bring Your RPG Companions to Life with AI-Assisted Conversations!

Imagine you're on an epic RPG adventure with a trusted companion. They comment on the world, react during battle, and share their thoughts—but it's always a one-sided conversation. No matter how immersive you want to be, they can’t hear you…
<br><br>
Until now.
<br><br>
With AI-assisted roleplay (not AI-driven), your NPC companions can finally respond to you in real time. When they speak their pre-set lines, you get the option to reply. Your response is recorded, transcribed, and processed by an AI that roleplays as the NPC—turning scripted dialogue into dynamic, interactive conversations.
<br><br>
No more talking to yourself—your companions are listening.
